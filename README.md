# Visualising changes in the youngish-adult population

R code that creates dot-density maps of changes in the New Zealand resident population aged between 20 and 34 years old. Side by side maps are produced for changes between 2001 and 2011, and between 2011 and 2021.

Output maps show Auckland but could be changed to any area of NZ.

Data is from Stats NZ subnational resident population estimates by SA2 area and 5-year age groups in [NZ.Stat](https://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx)
